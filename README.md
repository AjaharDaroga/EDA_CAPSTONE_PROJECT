EDA on Hotel Booking analysis

    Given data from hotel industry, with the help of 32 feature in dataset we trying to answer the problems which is to find best time of year to book a hotel room, Optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate and predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportional high number of special requests.
     
    Approach for solving above problems we need to understand the dataset with help of features. Finding the missing values is data and imputing with proper values, checking the duplicate records. Removing the feature which has more then 15% data is missing and removing the outliers. Finally visualize data for univariate analysis and multivariate analysis i.e., descriptive analysis.

    On EDA we understand to reduce the booking cancellation targets on online market segment with do deposit and sending special request. Focusing on transient type of customer with type A room availability and reduce the lead time. More number of bookings cancel in group market segment. The important is length of stay in resort hotel is more than the city hotel.

    After analyzing the data, we conclude that booking month to get best daily rate in Nov, Dec and Jan. Optimum length for better daily rate on weekend more than 2 days. More number of bookings cancel on every year in city hotel compare to resort hotel. Optimum length for better daily rate on week more than 6 days. More than 50% of hotel booking cancel in every year. Sending special request increases chance of hotel booking.
